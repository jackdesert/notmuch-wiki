<h1>NOTMUCH-SHOW(1)</h1>

<h2>NAME</h2>
<pre>
       notmuch-show - show messages matching the given search terms
</pre>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre>
       <b>notmuch</b> <b>show</b> [<u>options</u>...] &lt;<u>search-term</u>&gt;...
</pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<pre>
       Shows all messages matching the search terms.

       See  <a href='../notmuch-search-terms-7/'>notmuch-search-terms</a>(7)  for  details  of the supported syntax for
       &lt;search-terms&gt;.

       The messages will be grouped and sorted based  on  the  threading  (all
       replies to a particular message will appear immediately after that mes-
       sage in date order). The output is not indented by default,  but  depth
       tags are printed so that proper indentation can be performed by a post-
       processor (such as the emacs interface to notmuch).

       Supported options for <b>show</b> include

           <b>--entire-thread=(true|false)</b>

               If true, <b>notmuch</b> <b>show</b> outputs all messages in the thread of any
               message  matching  the  search terms; if false, it outputs only
               the matching messages. For <b>--format=json</b> and <b>--format=sexp</b> this
               defaults to true.  For other formats, this defaults to false.

           <b>--format=(text|json|sexp|mbox|raw)</b>

               <b>text</b> (default for messages)

                   The  default  plain-text  format  has all text-content MIME
                   parts decoded. Various components in the output,  (<b>message</b>,
                   <b>header</b>, <b>body</b>, <b>attachment</b>, and MIME <b>part</b>), will be delimited
                   by easily-parsed markers. Each marker consists  of  a  Con-
                   trol-L  character  (ASCII  decimal  12),  the  name  of the
                   marker, and then either an opening or closing  brace,  (&apos;{&apos;
                   or  &apos;}&apos;), to either open or close the component. For a mul-
                   tipart MIME message, these parts will be nested.

               <b>json</b>

                   The output is formatted  with  Javascript  Object  Notation
                   (JSON). This format is more robust than the text format for
                   automated processing. The  nested  structure  of  multipart
                   MIME  messages  is  reflected  in  nested  JSON  output. By
                   default JSON output includes all  messages  in  a  matching
                   thread; that is, by default,

                   <b>--format=json</b>  sets  <b>--entire-thread</b> The caller can disable
                   this behaviour by setting <b>--entire-thread=false</b>

               <b>sexp</b>

                   The output is formatted as  an  S-Expression  (sexp).  This
                   format  is  more  robust than the text format for automated
                   processing. The nested structure of multipart MIME messages
                   is  reflected in nested S-Expression output. By default, S-
                   Expression output  includes  all  messages  in  a  matching
                   thread; that is, by default,

                   <b>--format=sexp</b>  sets  <b>--entire-thread</b> The caller can disable
                   this behaviour by setting <b>--entire-thread=false</b>

               <b>mbox</b>

                   All matching messages are output in the  traditional,  Unix
                   mbox  format  with  each  message  being prefixed by a line
                   beginning with &quot;From &quot; and a  blank  line  separating  each
                   message.  Lines in the message content beginning with &quot;From
                   &quot; (preceded by zero or more &apos;&gt;&apos; characters) have  an  addi-
                   tional  &apos;&gt;&apos;  character  added.  This reversible escaping is
                   termed &quot;mboxrd&quot; format and described in detail here:

                   http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/mail-mbox-formats.html

               <b>raw</b> (default for a single part, see --part)

                   For a message or an attached message  part,  the  original,
                   raw  content  of  the email message is output. Consumers of
                   this format should expect to implement  MIME  decoding  and
                   similar functions.

                   For  a  single part (--part) the raw part content is output
                   after performing any necessary MIME  decoding.   Note  that
                   messages with a simple body still have two parts: part 0 is
                   the whole message and part 1 is the body.

                   For a multipart part, the part headers and body  (including
                   all child parts) is output.

                   The raw format must only be used with search terms matching
                   single message.

           <b>--format-version=N</b>

               Use the specified structured output format  version.   This  is
               intended  for  programs  that invoke <a href='../notmuch-1/'>notmuch</a>(1) internally.  If
               omitted, the latest supported version will be used.

           <b>--part=N</b>

               Output the single decoded MIME part N of a single message.  The
               search  terms  must match only a single message.  Message parts
               are numbered in a depth-first walk of the message  MIME  struc-
               ture, and are identified in the &apos;json&apos;, &apos;sexp&apos; or &apos;text&apos; output
               formats.

           <b>--verify</b>

               Compute and report the validity of any MIME cryptographic  sig-
               natures  found  in the selected content (ie. &quot;multipart/signed&quot;
               parts). Status of the signature will be reported (currently on-
               ly  supported  with  --format=json  and --format=sexp), and the
               multipart/signed part will be replaced by the signed data.

           <b>--decrypt</b>

               Decrypt any MIME encrypted parts found in the selected  content
               (ie.  &quot;multipart/encrypted&quot;  parts).  Status  of the decryption
               will be reported (currently only supported  with  --format=json
               and --format=sexp) and the multipart/encrypted part will be re-
               placed by the decrypted content.  Implies --verify.

           <b>--exclude=(true|false)</b>

               Specify whether to omit threads  only  matching  search.tag_ex-
               clude  from  the search results (the default) or not. In either
               case the excluded message will be marked with the exclude  flag
               (except  when  output=mbox  when  there  is  nowhere to put the
               flag).

               If --entire-thread is specified then complete threads  are  re-
               turned regardless (with the excluded flag being set when appro-
               priate) but threads that only match in an excluded message  are
               not returned when <b>--exclude=true.</b>

               The default is <b>--exclude=true.</b>

           <b>--body=(true|false)</b>

               If  true  (the default) <b>notmuch</b> <b>show</b> includes the bodies of the
               messages  in  the  output;  if  false,  bodies   are   omitted.
               <b>--body=false</b>  is only implemented for the json and sexp formats
               and it is incompatible with <b>--part</b> &gt<b>&</b>gt; <b>0.</b>

               This is useful if the caller only needs the  headers  as  body-
               less output is much faster and substantially smaller.

       A  common  use  of  <b>notmuch</b> <b>show</b> is to display a single thread of email
       messages. For this, use a search term of &quot;thread:&lt;thread-id&gt;&quot; as can be
       seen in the first column of output from the <b>notmuch</b> <b>search</b> command.
