<h1>NOTMUCH-SHOW(1)</h1>

<h2>NAME</h2>

<pre>
       notmuch-show - Show messages matching the given search terms.
</pre>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre>
       <b>notmuch</b> <b>show</b> [<u>options</u>...] <<u>search-term</u>>...
</pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<pre>
       Shows all messages matching the search terms.
</pre>

<pre>
       See  <b>notmuch-search-terms</b>(7)  for  details  of the supported syntax for
       <search-terms>.
</pre>

<pre>
       The messages will be grouped and sorted based  on  the  threading  (all
       replies to a particular message will appear immediately after that mes-
       sage in date order). The output is not indented by default,  but  depth
       tags are printed so that proper indentation can be performed by a post-
       processor (such as the emacs interface to notmuch).
</pre>

<pre>
       Supported options for <b>show</b> include
</pre>

<pre>
           <b>--entire-thread</b>
</pre>

<pre>
               By default only those messages that match the search terms will
               be displayed. With this option, all messages in the same thread
               as any matched message will be displayed.
</pre>

<pre>
           <b>--format=(text|json|mbox|raw)</b>
</pre>

<pre>
               <b>text</b> (default for messages)
</pre>

<pre>
                   The default plain-text format  has  all  text-content  MIME
                   parts  decoded. Various components in the output, (<b>message</b>,
                   <b>header</b>, <b>body</b>, <b>attachment</b>, and MIME <b>part</b>), will be delimited
                   by  easily-parsed  markers.  Each marker consists of a Con-
                   trol-L character  (ASCII  decimal  12),  the  name  of  the
                   marker,  and  then either an opening or closing brace, ('{'
                   or '}'), to either open or close the component. For a  mul-
                   tipart MIME message, these parts will be nested.
</pre>

<pre>
               <b>json</b>
</pre>

<pre>
                   The  output  is  formatted  with Javascript Object Notation
                   (JSON). This format is more robust than the text format for
                   automated  processing.  The  nested  structure of multipart
                   MIME messages is reflected in nested JSON output. JSON out-
                   put  always  includes all messages in a matching thread; in
                   effect <b>--format=json</b> implies <b>--entire-thread</b>
</pre>

<pre>
               <b>mbox</b>
</pre>

<pre>
                   All matching messages are output in the  traditional,  Unix
                   mbox  format  with  each  message  being prefixed by a line
                   beginning with "From " and a  blank  line  separating  each
                   message.  Lines in the message content beginning with "From
                   " (preceded by zero or more '>' characters) have  an  addi-
                   tional  '>'  character  added.  This reversible escaping is
                   termed "mboxrd" format and described in detail here:

</pre>

<pre>
               <b>raw</b> (default for a single part, see --part)
</pre>

<pre>
                   For a message or an attached message  part,  the  original,
                   raw  content  of  the email message is output. Consumers of
                   this format should expect to implement  MIME  decoding  and
                   similar functions.
</pre>

<pre>
                   For  a  single part (--part) the raw part content is output
                   after performing any necessary MIME  decoding.   Note  that
                   messages with a simple body still have two parts: part 0 is
                   the whole message and part 1 is the body.
</pre>

<pre>
                   For a multipart part, the part headers and body  (including
                   all child parts) is output.
</pre>

<pre>
                   The raw format must only be used with search terms matching
                   single message.
</pre>

<pre>
           <b>--part=N</b>
</pre>

<pre>
               Output the single decoded MIME part N of a single message.  The
               search  terms  must match only a single message.  Message parts
               are numbered in a depth-first walk of the message  MIME  struc-
               ture,  and  are  identified in the 'json' or 'text' output for-
               mats.
</pre>

<pre>
           <b>--verify</b>
</pre>

<pre>
               Compute and report the validity of any MIME cryptographic  sig-
               natures  found  in the selected content (ie. "multipart/signed"
               parts). Status of the signature will be reported (currently on-
               ly supported with --format=json), and the multipart/signed part
               will be replaced by the signed data.
</pre>

<pre>
           <b>--decrypt</b>
</pre>

<pre>
               Decrypt any MIME encrypted parts found in the selected  content
               (ie.  "multipart/encrypted"  parts).  Status  of the decryption
               will be reported (currently only supported with  --format=json)
               and  the  multipart/encrypted  part will be replaced by the de-
               crypted content.  Implies --verify.
</pre>

<pre>
           <b>--exclude=(true|false)</b>
</pre>

<pre>
               Specify whether to omit threads  only  matching  search.tag_ex-
               clude  from  the search results (the default) or not. In either
               case the excluded message will be marked with the exclude  flag
               (except  when  output=mbox  when  there  is  nowhere to put the
               flag).
</pre>

<pre>
               If --entire-thread is specified then complete threads  are  re-
               turned regardless (with the excluded flag being set when appro-
               priate) but threads that only match in an excluded message  are
               not returned when <b>--exclude=true.</b>
</pre>

<pre>
               The default is <b>--exclude=true.</b>
</pre>

<pre>
       A  common  use  of  <b>notmuch</b> <b>show</b> is to display a single thread of email
       messages. For this, use a search term of "thread:<thread-id>" as can be
       seen in the first column of output from the <b>notmuch</b> <b>search</b> command.
