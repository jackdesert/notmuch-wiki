<h1>NOTMUCH-REPLY(1)</h1>

<h2>NAME</h2>

<pre>
       notmuch-reply - Constructs a reply template for a set of messages.
</pre>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre>
       <b>notmuch</b> <b>reply</b> [<u>options</u>...] <<u>search-term</u>>...
</pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<pre>
       Constructs a reply template for a set of messages.
</pre>

<pre>
       To  make  replying to email easier, <b>notmuch</b> <b>reply</b> takes an existing set
       of messages and constructs a  suitable  mail  template.  The  Reply-to:
       header  (if  any,  otherwise From:) is used for the To: address. Unless
       <b>--reply-to=sender</b> is specified, values from the To: and Cc: headers are
       copied, but not including any of the current user's email addresses (as
       configured in primary_mail or other_email in the .notmuch-config  file)
       in the recipient list.
</pre>

<pre>
       It  also  builds a suitable new subject, including Re: at the front (if
       not already present), and adding the message IDs of the messages  being
       replied  to  to  the References list and setting the In-Reply-To: field
       correctly.
</pre>

<pre>
       Finally, the original contents of the emails are  quoted  by  prefixing
       each line with '> ' and included in the body.
</pre>

<pre>
       The resulting message template is output to stdout.
</pre>

<pre>
       Supported options for <b>reply</b> include
</pre>

<pre>
              <b>--format=</b>(<b>default</b>|<b>json</b>|<b>headers-only</b>)
</pre>

<pre>
                  <b>default</b>
                      Includes subject and quoted message body.
</pre>

<pre>
                  <b>json</b>
                      Produces JSON output containing headers for a reply mes-
                      sage and the contents of the original message. This out-
                      put  can  be  used by a client to create a reply message
                      intelligently.
</pre>

<pre>
                  <b>headers-only</b>
                      Only produces In-Reply-To, References, To, Cc,  and  Bcc
                      headers.
</pre>

<pre>
              <b>--reply-to=</b>(<b>all</b>|<b>sender</b>)
</pre>

<pre>
                  <b>all</b> (default)
                      Replies to all addresses.
</pre>

<pre>
                  <b>sender</b>
                      Replies  only  to  the sender. If replying to user's own
                      message (Reply-to: or From: header is one of the  user's
                      configured  email  addresses),  try  To:,  Cc:, and Bcc:
                      headers in this order, and copy values  from  the  first
                      that  contains  something  other  than  only  the user's
                      addresses.
</pre>

<pre>
              <b>--decrypt</b>
</pre>

<pre>
                  Decrypt any MIME  encrypted  parts  found  in  the  selected
                  content  (ie.  "multipart/encrypted"  parts).  Status of the
                  decryption will be reported (currently only  supported  with
                  --format=json)  and  the  multipart/encrypted  part  will be
                  replaced by the decrypted content.
</pre>

<pre>
       See <b>notmuch-search-terms</b>(7) for details of  the  supported  syntax  for
       <search-terms>.
</pre>

<pre>
       Note:  It  is  most  common  to  use <b>notmuch</b> <b>reply</b> with a search string
       matching a single message, (such as id:<message-id>),  but  it  can  be
       useful to reply to several messages at once. For example, when a series
       of patches are sent in a single thread, replying to the  entire  thread
       allows  for  the  reply to comment on issues found in multiple patches.
       The default format supports replying to multiple messages at once,  but
       the JSON format does not.
