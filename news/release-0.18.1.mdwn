Notmuch 0.18.1 (2014-06-25)
===========================

This is a bug fix and portability release.

Build System
------------

### Add a workaround for systems without zlib.pc

### Make emacs install robust against the non-existence of emacs

### Put notmuch lib directory first in RPATH

### Fix handling of `html_static_path` in sphinx

Both the python bindings and the main docs had spurious settings of
this variable.

Test Suite
----------

### Use --quick when starting emacs

This avoids a hang in the T160-json tests.

### Allow pending break points in atomicity script

This allows the atomicity tests to run on several more architectures/OSes.

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

To improve portability use fsync instead of fdatasync in
`notmuch-dump`. There should be no functional difference.

Library changes
---------------

### Resurrect support for single-message mbox files

The removal introduced a bug with previously indexed single-message
mboxes.  This support remains deprecated.

### Fix for phrase indexing

There were several bugs where words intermingled from different
headers and MIME parts could match a single phrase query.  This fix
will affect only newly indexed messages.

Emacs Interface
---------------

### Make sure tagging on an empty query is harmless

Previously tagging an empty query could lead to tags being
unintentionally removed.
