Notmuch 0.11 (2012-01-13)
=========================

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

### Hooks

  Hooks have been introduced to notmuch. Hooks are scripts that notmuch
  invokes before and after certain actions. Initially, `notmuch new`
  supports `pre-new` and `post-new` hooks that are run before and after
  importing new messages into the database.

### `notmuch reply --decrypt bugfix`

  The `notmuch reply` command with `--decrypt` argument had a rarely
  occurring bug that caused an encrypted message not to be decrypted
  sometimes. This is now fixed.

Performance
-----------

### Automatic tag query optimization

  `notmuch tag` now automatically optimizes the user's query to
  exclude messages whose tags won't change.  In the past, we've
  suggested that people do this by hand; this is no longer necessary.

### Don't sort messages when creating a dump file

  This speeds up tag dumps considerably, without any loss of
  information. To replicate the old behavior of sorted output (for
  example to compare two dump files), one can use e.g. `sort(1)`.

Memory Management
-----------------

### Reduction of memory leaks

  Two memory leaks when searching and showing messages were identified
  and fixed in this release.

Emacs Interface
---------------

### Bug fixes

  notmuch-show-advance (bound to the spacebar in notmuch-show-mode) had
  a bug that caused it to always jump to the next message, even if it
  should have scrolled down to show more of the current message instead.
  This is now fixed.

### Support `notmuch new` as a notmuch-poll-script

  It's now possible to use `notmuch new` as a notmuch-poll-script
  directly. This is also the new default. This allows taking better
  advantage of the `notmuch new` hooks from emacs without intermediate
  scripts.

### Improvements in saved search management

  New saved searches are now appended to the list of saved searches,
  not inserted in front. It's also possible to define a sort function
  for displaying saved searches; alphabetical sort is provided.

### Hooks for notmuch-hello

  Two new hooks have been added: "notmuch-hello-mode-hook" (called after
  entering notmuch-hello-mode) and "notmuch-hello-refresh-hook" (called
  after updating a notmuch-hello buffer).

### New face for crypto parts headers

  Crypto parts used to be displayed with a hardcoded color. A new face
  has been introduced to fix this: notmuch-crypto-part-header. It
  defaults to the same value as before, but can be customized to match
  other color themes.

### Use space as default thousands separator

  Large numbers in notmuch-hello are now displayed using a space as
  thousands separator (e.g. "123 456" instead of "123,456"). This can be
  changed by customizing "notmuch-hello-thousands-separator".

### Call notmuch-show instead of notmuch-search when clicking on
### buttonized id: links.

### New function notmuch-show-advance

  This new function advances through just the current thread, and is
  less invasive than notmuch-show-advance-and-archive.  It can easily
  be bound to SPC with:

	(define-key notmuch-show-mode-map " " 'notmuch-show-advance)

### Various performance improvements

New add-on tool
---------------

The tool `contrib/notmuch-deliver` helps with initial delivery and
tagging of mail (replacing running `notmuch new`).
