Notmuch 0.3.1 (2010-04-27)
==========================

General bug fixes
-----------------

### Fix an infinite loop in "notmuch reply"

  This bug could be triggered by replying to a message where the
  user's primary email address did not appear in the To: header and
  the user had not configured any secondary email addresses. The bug
  was a simple re-use of the same iterator variable in nested loops.

### Fix a potential SEGV in "notmuch search"

  This bug could be triggered by an author name ending in a ','.
  Admittedly - that's almost certainly a spam email, but we never
  want notmuch to crash.

Emacs bug fixes
---------------

### Fix calculations for line wrapping in the primary "notmuch" view

### Fix Fcc support to prompt to create a directory if the specified Fcc directory does not exist

Build fix
---------

### Fix build on OpenSolaris (at least) due to missing 'extern "C"' block

  Without this, the C++ sources could not find strcasestr and the
  final linking of notmuch would fail.
