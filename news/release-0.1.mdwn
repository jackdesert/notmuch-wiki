Notmuch 0.1 (2010-04-05)
========================
This is the first release of the notmuch mail system.

It includes the libnotmuch library, the notmuch command-line
interface, and an emacs-based interface to notmuch.

Note: Notmuch will work best with Xapian 1.0.18 (or later) or Xapian
1.1.4 (or later). Previous versions of Xapian (whether 1.0 or 1.1) had
a performance bug that made notmuch very slow when modifying
tags. This would cause distracting pauses when reading mail while
notmuch would wait for Xapian when removing the "inbox" and "unread"
tags from messages in a thread.
