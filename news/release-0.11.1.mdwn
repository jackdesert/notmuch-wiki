Notmuch 0.11.1 (2012-02-03)
===========================

Bug-fix release.
----------------

### Fix error handling in python bindings

  The python bindings in 0.11 failed to detect NULL pointers being
  returned from libnotmuch functions and thus failed to raise
  exceptions to indicate the error condition. Any subsequent calls
  into libnotmuch caused segmentation faults.

### Quote MML tags in replies

  MML tags are text codes that Emacs uses to indicate attachments
  (among other things) in messages being composed.  The Emacs
  interface did not quote MML tags in the quoted text of a reply.
  User could be tricked into replying to a maliciously formatted
  message and not editing out the MML tags from the quoted text.  This
  could lead to files from the user's machine being attached to the
  outgoing message.  The Emacs interface now quotes these tags in
  reply text, so that they do not effect outgoing messages.
