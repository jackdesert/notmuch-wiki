Notmuch 0.8 (2011-09-10)
========================

* **_Improved handling of message/rfc822 parts_**

  Both in the CLI and the emacs interface.  Output of rfc822 parts now
  includes the primary headers, as well as the body and all subparts.
  Output of the completely raw rfc822-formatted message, including all
  headers, is unfortunately not yet supported (but hopefully will be
  soon).

* **_Improved Build system portability_**

  Certain parts of the shell script generating notmuch.sym were
  specific to the GNU versions of sed and nm. The new version should
  be more portable to e.g. OpenBSD.

* **_Documentation update for Ruby bindings_**

  Added documentation, typo fixes, and improved support for rdoc.

* **_Unicode, iterator, PEP8 changes for python bindings_**

  - PEP8 (code formatting) changes for python files.
  - Remove `Tags.__len__` ; see 0.6 release notes for motivation.
  - Decode headers as UTF8, encode (unicode) database paths as UTF8.
