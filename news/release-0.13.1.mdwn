Notmuch 0.13.1 (2012-05-29)
===========================

Bug-fix release
---------------

### Fix inserting of UTF-8 characters from *text/plain* parts in reply

While notmuch gained ability to insert content from other than *text/plain*
parts of email whenever *text/plain* parts are not available (notably
HTML-only emails), replying to mails that do have *text/plain* the
non-ASCII characters were incorrectly decoded. This is now fixed.

### `notmuch_database_get_directory` and `notmuch_database_find_message_by_filename` now work on read-only databases

Previously, these functions attempted to create directory documents
that didn't exist and would return an error or abort when given a
read-only database.  Now they no longer create directory documents
and simply return a `NULL` object if the directory does not exist,
as documented.

Fix compilation of ruby bindings.

Revert to dynamic linking, since the statically linked bindings did
not work well.
