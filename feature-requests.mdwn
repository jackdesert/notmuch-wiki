#List of features people have requested and ideas that people want to keep thinking about

## Emacs client

+ Add 'd' keybinding<br>
Removes unread and inbox tags, adds deleted tag.<br>
When used from a search results view, it deletes the thread that the cursor is on<br>
When used from the thread view, it deletes the currently displayed message inside the thread

+ add 'D' keybinding<br>
Removes unread and inbox tags, adds deleted tag.<br>
When used from a search results view, it deletes the thread that the cursor is on (just like 'd')<br>
When used from the thread view, it deletes the currently displayed thread (and not just the message)<br>

+ add '???' keybinding<br>
Skips current thread without archiving it<br>
Right now 'n' gets me to the end of a thread, but not to the beginning of the next thread. 'a' gets you to the next thread, but archives the current one.

## notmuch 

+ Add folder keyword<br>
Allows to search for messages in a specific folder

+ Allow anchors in searches<br>
notmuch search from:domain.org$ only matches if "domain.org" is at the end of the From: header<br>
notmuch search from:^username only matches if "username" is at the beginning of the From: header (right after the ':')<br>
This leaves the interesting question if we want a way to bind to the actual address component.

+ Add Received: header to the indexed header components<br>
allows for searches based on the arrival path

## 3rd part apps

### notmuchsync

+ Add feature to move files in the maildir hierarchy<br>
notmuchsync --move "searchstring" "targetfolder"<br>
Where searchstring is any valid notmuch search
