:When used from a search results view, it deletes the thread that the cursor is on
:When used from the thread view, it deletes the currently displayed message inside the thread

+ add 'D' keybinding
:Removes unread and inbox tags, adds deleted tag. 
:When used from a search results view, it deletes the thread that the cursor is on (just like 'd')
:When used from the thread view, it deletes the currently displayed thread (and not just the message)


## notmuch 

+ Add folder keyword
:Allows to search for messages in a specific folder

+ Allow anchors in searches
:notmuch search from:domain.org$ only matches if "domain.org" is at the end of the From: header
:notmuch search from:^username only matches if "username" is at the beginning of the From: header (right after the ':')
:This leaves the interesting question if we want a way to bind to the actual address component.

+ Add Received: header to the indexed header components
:allows for searches based on the arrival path

## 3rd part apps

### notmuchsync
