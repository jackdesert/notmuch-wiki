#List of features people have requested and ideas that people want to keep thinking about

## Emacs client

+    Add 'd' keybinding

     Removes unread and inbox tags, adds deleted tag.
     
     When used from a search results view, it deletes the thread that
     the cursor is on.

     When used from the thread view, it deletes the currently
     displayed message inside the thread.

+    add 'D' keybinding

     Removes unread and inbox tags, adds deleted tag.

     When used from a search results view, it deletes the thread that
     the cursor is on (just like 'd')

     When used from the thread view, it deletes the currently
     displayed thread (and not just the message)

+    add '???' keybinding

     Skips current thread without archiving it

     Right now 'n' gets me to the end of a thread, but not to the
     beginning of the next thread. 'a' gets you to the next thread,
     but archives the current one.

+   select from address (with the configured email addresses as default choices to pick from)

+   allow different "real names" for the optional email addresses

     if only one name is configured, use that for all addresses;
     if other_names are configured, match those with the other_email addresses

## notmuch 

+    Add folder keyword

     Allows to search for messages in a specific folder.

+    Index more headers.  Some desired headers:

  + Received: allows for searches based on the arrival path
  + Reply-To: allows for searches based on the return address

+    Allow anchors in searches

     notmuch search from:domain.org$ only matches if "domain.org" is
     at the end of the From: header

     notmuch search from:^username only matches if "username" is at
     the beginning of the From: header (right after the ':')

     This leaves the interesting question if we want a way to bind to
     the actual address component.

## 3rd party apps

### notmuchsync

+    Add feature to move files in the maildir hierarchy

     notmuchsync --move "searchstring" "targetfolder"

     Where searchstring is any valid notmuch search
