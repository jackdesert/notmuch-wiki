# Experimental Tag Sharing / Pseudo-Bug-Tracking for/with notmuch

## getting set up

1. The current set of patches against notmuch master is in branch nmbug, 

    git://pivot.cs.unb.ca/notmuch.git

    Currently you need at least the version of notmuch in master, and
    the script in contrib/nmbug.
      
2. The current tag repo is at

    git clone --bare git://pivot.cs.unb.ca/nmbug.git $HOME/.nmbug


## Using nmbug

    # suck in the tags
    $ nmbug checkout

    [ do some tagging; see below for conventions ]
    
    $ nmbug commit


## Submitting tags.

   For the moment, we are using a central repo, hosted at
    
        git@pivot.cs.unb.ca:pub/nmbug
        
   To get push access, send your public key (ideally in a gpg signed
   email) to David Bremner.  There is a convenience command
   
       nmbug push
       
   But you will have to change your url with
   
       git remote origin set-url git@pivot.cs.unb.ca:pub/nmbug

## Tagging conventions

    notmuch::bug                is a bug report

    notmuch::obsolete           replaced by some other patch
    notmuch::patch           
    notmuch::portability        improves portability
    notmuch::pushed             is pushed to master
    notmuch::review             is a review
    notmuch::reviewed           has been (well) reviewed
    notmuch::test               provides a new test/or improves testing

## Design notes

### Disk format.

The tags are stored in a bare-repo, which means they are not obviously
visible. There is an `nmbug archive` command analogous to `git
archive` Tags are represented as empty files in the tree; if you extra
them, the tree looks something like


    tags/878waiwi0f.wl%25james@hackervisions.org/
    tags/878waiwi0f.wl%25james@hackervisions.org/emacs
    tags/878waiwi0f.wl%25james@hackervisions.org/patch
    tags/87aa8j7hqu.fsf@zancas.localnet/
    tags/87aa8j7hqu.fsf@zancas.localnet/patch
    tags/87aa8j7hqu.fsf@zancas.localnet/pushed

The `%25` represents hex code for a character that cannot be used directly
(in this case %, only because it is needed as an escape).

### Assumptions

- Currently the parser of nmbug (like that of notmuch restore) assumes 
  that there are no spaces in message-ids.
