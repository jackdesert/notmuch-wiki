##<span id="print_filenames">.. print only filenames of a search</span>

Given you have the python bindings installed (or simply set your PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to the .../bindings/python directory), this script will print the filenames of a matching search:

                                #!/usr/bin/env python
                                import sys
                                import notmuch
                                
                                q = notmuch.Database().create_query(" ".join(sys.argv[1:]))
                                for m in q.search_messages(): print m.get_filename()
