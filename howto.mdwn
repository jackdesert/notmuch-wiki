#How to...

* <span id="print_filenames">.. print only filenames of a search</span>

Given you have the python bindings installed (or simply set your PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to the .../bindings/python directory), this script will print the filenames of a matching search:

                                #!/usr/bin/env python
                                import sys
                                import notmuch
                                
                                q = notmuch.Database().create_query(" ".join(sys.argv[1:]))
                                for m in q.search_messages(): print m.get_filename()

* <span id="sync_maildir_flags">.. sync notmuch tags and maildir flags</span>

  Some IMAP users rely on maildir flags that convey the status "seen",
  "replied", "trashed", in order to synchronize the status of their
  mail across mail clients (a [maildir
  flag](http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html) is simply a defined part
  of their filename).  Notmuch will by default happily ignore those
  flags and will never modify them either, as there is no built-in
  support for sunchronizing your notmuch tags with your imap maildir
  flags (seen, replied, trashed, etc). However there are currently 2
  ways in which you can achieve synchronization.

  [notmuchsync](http://spaetz.github.com/notmuchsync/) is a utility
  that allows synchronization in either direction, as well as pruning
  of deleted files.

  The second solution allows for fast maildir flag to notmuch tag
  synchronization (and only in that direction) requires patching the
  notmuch source code. The patch has been posted in this mail
  *id:1267450136-31749-1-git-send-email-Sebastian@SSpaeth.de* and can
  be viewed as a [source diff in this git
  repository](http://github.com/spaetz/notmuch-all-feature/commit/df3b087cefb85e9d16fd17540e348bcb854dd7ee).
