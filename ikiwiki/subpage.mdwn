ikiwiki supports placing pages in a directory hierarchy. For example,
this page, [[SubPage]] has some related pages placed under it, like
[[SubPage/LinkingRules]]. This is a useful way to add some order to your
wiki rather than just having a great big directory full of pages.

To add a SubPage, just make a subdirectory and put pages in it. For
example, this page is SubPage.mdwn in this wiki's source, and there is also
a SubPage subdirectory, which contains SubPage/LinkingRules.mdwn. Subpages
can be nested as deeply as you'd like.

Linking to and from a SubPage is explained in [[LinkingRules]].
