[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
is a minimal markup language that resembles plain text as used in
email messages. It is the markup language used by this wiki by default.

For documentation about the markdown syntax, see [[formatting]] and
[Markdown: syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

Note that [[WikiLinks|WikiLink]] and [[directives|directive]] are not part
of the markdown syntax, and are the only bit of markup that this wiki
handles internally.
